// Operator[] works by returning a reference to the place in memory
// that's designated by the index. This works well for memory-based
// arrays, but isn't helpful for a file-based array. In particular,
// since operator[] is not told whether it was on the left side or
// right side of an assignment, we need a way to figure that out.
//
// This operator[] always gets the indexed char from the file, stores
// it in 'ch', and returns a reference to 'ch'. This works fine when
// operator[] is called on the righthand side of an assignment because
// the code compiled for the assignment copies the value out of 'ch'
// into the lefthand side of the assignment.
//
// When this operator[] is called on the lefthand side of an assignment,
// the code compiled for the assignment copies the value of the righthand
// side into 'ch' via the reference that operator[] returns. This,
// however, does not write that data into the file. For that to happen,
// operator[] needs to realize that it was on the lefthand side of
// the assignment.
//
// Since an assignment using operator[] on its lefthand side stores
// the data into 'ch', operator[] can tell that this has happened
// the NEXT time it's called by looking to see if the data in 'ch'
// has been changed 'from the outside' by the assignment. It does this
// by storing values from the previous time it was called. This allows
// it to discover if it was called on the lefthand side by comparing
// the data in the 'ch' data member to what it put into 'ch' the previous
// time. If that has changed, then the previous call was on the lefthand
// side and the file needs to be updated.
